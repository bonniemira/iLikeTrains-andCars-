## My process

1. Panic
2. Break a lot of things.
3. Read more about Flexboxes
4. ???
5. Profit... but only in a sense of personal accomplishment.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- No Real Clue


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about breakpoints, about controlling aspect ratios in my responsive code, and well, a lot more of everything.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/) - This helped me review new concepts when I got overwhelmed and forgot which thing did what. 
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - Shoutout to Janet for being my personal tutor and answering all my questions without just handing me code, as I wanted to learn, not copy/paste. I've already got that skill nailed down.
